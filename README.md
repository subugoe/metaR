This package is for internal use at [SUB GÃ¶ttingen](http://sub.uni-goettingen.de).
It is about how we work.

<div class="alert alert-info">
  All of these are suggestions only and should never get in the way of how people prefer to work.
</div>

It provides:

1. Documentation for suggested best practices around R data analysis at SUB in the form of vignettes.
  Most of this is links to other resources.
2. [A place to log placeholder issues for ideas](https://github.com/subugoe/metaR/issues) to improve our workflows with development in other packages, or of new packages.
3. [{usethis}](http://usethis.r-lib.org)-style setup functions with sensible defaults for data analysis.
  Most of these are (very thin) wrappers around existing functions.
