This package is for internal at [SUB GÃ¶ttingen](http://sub.uni-goettingen.de).

It provides:

- [x] Documentation for suggested best practices around R data analysis at SUB in the form of vignettes.
  Most of this is links to other resources.
- [ ] [{usethis}](http://usethis.r-lib.org)-style setup functions with sensible defaults for data analysis.
  Most of these are (very thin) wrappers around existing functions.

All of these are suggestions only and should never get in the way of how people prefer to work.


## Installation
