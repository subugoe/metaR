This package is for internal use at [SUB GÃ¶ttingen](http://sub.uni-goettingen.de).
It is about how we work.

<div class="alert alert-info">
  All of these are suggestions only and should never get in the way of how people prefer to work.
</div>

It provides:

1. Wraps [muggle](http://subugoe.github.io/muggle/) setup functions for R best practices with SUB-specific defaults.
2. Documentation for suggested best practices around R data analysis at SUB in the form of vignettes.
  Most of this is links to other resources.
3. [A place to log placeholder issues for ideas](https://github.com/subugoe/metar/issues) to improve our workflows with development in other packages, or of new packages.


## Installation

You can install the released version of {metar} from [GitHub](https://github.com/subugoe/metar) with:

``` r
remotes::install_github("subugoe/metar")
```

This package will never go to CRAN, because it is not useful for people outside of SUB.
