This package is for internal at [SUB GÃ¶ttingen](http://sub.uni-goettingen.de).
It is about **how we work**.

**All of these are suggestions only and should never get in the way of how people prefer to work.**

It provides:

- [x] Documentation for suggested best practices around R data analysis at SUB in the form of vignettes.
  Most of this is links to other resources.
- [x] A place to log placeholder issues for ideas to improve our workflows with development in other packages, or of new packages.
- [ ] [{usethis}](http://usethis.r-lib.org)-style setup functions with sensible defaults for data analysis.
  Most of these are (very thin) wrappers around existing functions.


## Installation
